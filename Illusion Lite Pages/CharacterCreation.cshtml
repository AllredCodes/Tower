            <h2>Character Creation</h2>

            <p>
                Character creation might seem complicated at first glance, but once you've gone through it once, every subsequent character will be easy! 
                The game runner should run through this process at least once before the group gets together to play to ensure it goes smoothly. Players should consider
                making a diverse group of characters without too much overlapping aptitudes, so they can more effectively tackle a wide array of challenges.
            </p>
            

            The character creation process goes as follows, with each step being further detailed below;

                <li>Picking a <em>Race</em></li>

                <li>Spending <em>Skill Points</em></li>

    <div class="card" id="PickRace">
        <h2>Picking a Race</h2>

        <p>
            A large part of character creation in Illusion is selecting your character’s race, as it provides an influence on your character’s attribute 
            scores and their roleplaying direction. While there are only six races present in Illusion, as shown in the table below, players are invited to 
            create their own races, or modify the existing ones, so long as the other players at the table, specifically the Game Master, are okay with it. 
            Each character is required to have one race attributed to their character, no more, no less.
        </p>

        <p>
            Presented below are the mechanical effects of each race, but those interested in more details regarding each race's personality and fixture in the 
            World of Illusion can refer to the <a href="/Illusion Lite Pages/Races">Races section under the core rules.</a>

        </table>

        <p>
            Players might also take this time to flesh out the core concept of their character's personality. What motivates them? What do they do for a living? What are they good and bad at?
            There's plenty of ways one can make their character more than just a list of numbers and tags. Discuss with the other players who the character's are and why they're adventuring together!

            <div>
                <h2>Generating Attribute Scores</h2>

                <p>
                    Once everyone has their character idea decided on, all the players will next decide on their attribute scores. There are 6 primary attributes
                    in Illusion: Might, Control, Vigor, Logic, Reason, and Disposition. These are detailed in the [section on attributes]. These attributes are fairly typical for
                    table top games, and likely mean exactly what one first thinks upon reading them. The primary attributes scores are intended to be generated randomly as detailed 
                    below. Players must generate 6 numbers and then either apply them to the attributes in the order they were generated, or choose which attribute to apply each score to.
                </p>

                <h3>Generation</h3>
                <p>
                    During score generation and before applying racial bonuses, each attribute score can range from 2 to 5. Should a score be raised
                    over 5, or lowered below 2, the overflow is ignored and the score is set to the closest value within the accepted range, either 5 or 2. Because of this, there are
                    2 reccomended ways to generate these numbers; Roll 6, 4-sided dice (d4) and add 1 to each result, <strong>or</strong> roll 6, 6-sided dice (d6) and reroll all results 
                    of 1 or 6. Both of these methods have the same odds for each result and it really comes down to what your group prefers to roll between d4s and d6s. Write down the 
                    resulting number sets on some scratch paper and move on to applying the scores.
                </p>

                <div class="subCard">
                    <h3><em>Optional</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        Some players find random stat generation to be unfair and prefer to use "stat arrays" so that every player character at the table is on equal footing. That's just fine,
                        though it can dilude some other character mechanics. The array used should fall into the same range as rolled scores- I would recommend using the array 
                        <strong>[2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]</strong>, though players are welcome to come up with their own. Simply ignore the generation step and pretend these were the scores generated for each player, and apply them.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Application</h3>
                <p>
                    Once the 6 numbers are generated, they're distributed among the attributes, one to one. Once all the scores are distributed, racial bonuses are applied, which can result
                    in scores totaling over 5 or under 2, which is acceptable at this step in the process.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Determining Secondary Attributes</h3>
                <p>
                    Secondary attributes are scores that are derived from the primary attributes generated above. The meaning and application of these scores are detailed in the [section on
                    attributes], but to determine what their actual values are, refer to the outline below;


                    <table id="SecondaryAttributes">
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>Resistance:</strong></td> <td>10 + Might Score + Vigor Score</td>

                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>Evasion:</strong></td> <td>10 + Control Score + Logic Score</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>Resolve:</strong></td> <td>10 + Disposition Score + Reason Score</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>Awareness:</strong></td> <td>10 + Reason Score</td>
                        </tr>

                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>Destiny:</strong></td> <td>[Not yet determined]</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>Health:</strong></td> <td>2 + Might Score + Vigor Score</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>Movement:</strong></td> <td>1 + Control Score</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>Carry Limit:</strong></td> <td>((Might &times; 2) + Vigor)</td>
                        </tr>                        
                    </table>

                    <br />
                    Once players are done determining their secondary attributes, they will be ready to move on to the next step of character creation.

    <div class="card" id="PickIdentity">
        <h2>Choosing an Identity</h2>

        <p>
            At this point, players will choose an <em>Identity</em> for their characters. Identities most closely resemble classes from traditional tabletop roleplaying games,
            however they deliberately lack depth. Each identity will confer a bonus during character creation and inform the character’s background and training. It should be
            noted however, that your character doesn’t need to reflect the title of their identity and players can even come up with their own names to use over the default ones.
            For example, if a player wants to make a character that’s background is that of a spy, but they want the bonuses that the Larcenist identity gives, their identity
            can be: Spy (Larcenist).This doesn’t interfere with the actual mechanics of identities, so players are encouraged to do whatever suits their character’s story!
        </p>

        <p>
            Below are the current identities to pick from, though more will likely be added over time. The first column is the name of the identity, the second column is the skill point bonus
            gained from selecting the identity and the last column is the additional bonus one might gain such as character features or equipment.

    <div class="card" id="SpendingSkillPoints">
        <h2>Spending Skill Points</h2>

        <p>
            Skills are like attributes but more specific to various situations. There are 6 skill groups, one for each attribute and, as a result, 
            each skill has a constituting attribute score. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Rather than having a pool of generic skill points to assign from, each character generates points into 6 groups, one for each attribute. 
            These skill points can only be spent on skills that are governed by the same attribute that generated the points. This means that if a 
            character has a Might score of 3, they would generate 3 Might Skill Points that can only be spent on Might Skills. Skill points are spent 
            one to one, so all points of each attribute can be spent on one skill or as many different skills as the player has points for, within 
            the attribute’s skill options. The only stipulation, however, is that a skill’s score cannot exceed the score of its governing attribute. 
            If a situation is created where that one rule must be broken for all skill points to be spent, the unspent skills points are instead lost, so allocate wisely!
        </p>

            Remember when choosing skills that a character doesn't have to be good everything on their own. Players should understand that the nature of the game is to rely on one another
            for good situational coverage. Once players are done distributing their skill points, they're ready to move on to the next step of character creation. 
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="card" id="PickingFeatures">
        <h2>Picking Features</h2>
    
        <p>
            Features are special bonuses or abilities that your character can access by selecting them during character creation or while leveling up. 
            These can be special moves to perform in combat, different ways to use a character’s existing skills, improvements to a character’s attribute 
            scores, and more. Features add a lot of character to the game and are, in a lot of ways, the heart of Illusion!
        </p>
        <p>
            Players might find that their options for what they can do during the game seem limited, but features are ultimately geared toward allowing players to
            tweak their character to play how they think it should.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example: Characters are not able to move and attack in the same action by default, but the Charge Attack enables that particular behavior if selected.
            As a result, some players might think that taking Charge Attack is a given, <em>however</em> if a player wanted their character to be a strategist, issuing
            attack orders to allies rather than ever attacking on their own, that feature point would certainly be more well spend elsewhere (might I suggest Tactician?).
        </p>
        <p>
            Not all, but some features will have one or more prerequisite before your character can take it. Prerequisites are simple requirements that must be met before
            the feature can be taken onto your character. These come in 3 forms;
        </p>   

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Score Gate:</strong> These require that certain attribute or skill score minimums are met</li>
            <li><strong>Feature Branch:</strong> These require that other features have been picked beforehand</li>
            <li><strong>Core:</strong> Core features can only be taken during character creation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>    
            During character creation, each player may select 2 features for their character. Listed below are the features with the <strong>Core</strong> prerequisite, but 
            more features are available in [the section on Features.] Again, the features that are considered <em>Core</em> can only be taken during character creation, but 
            that doesn't mean that only Core features can be taken during character creation, so if none of them strike your fancy, feel free to pick from all the others!

            <h3><em>A Note on Bonuses</em></h3>
            <p>In case it isn't clear, a Bonus and a skill improvement are different! I'll explain;</p>
            <p>
                <strong>A skill improvement</strong> does quite exactly what it sounds like- it improves your character's score for a specific skill. A consistent rule for that, however, is that
                the score for that skill can <em>never exceed the skill's governing attribute.</em> This means, for example, if a character with a Might score of 3 and a Athletics score of 2 gains,
                for whatever reason, a skill improvement of 2 to their Athletics skill, their Athletics score will be raised to 3 and the overflow point of 1 will be lost. This is because the
                character's Athletics score can't exceed its governing attribute score, Might.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>A Bonus</strong>, is fundamentally different because there is no upper limit to a skill's bonus score. Bonuses function exactly like skill improvements during the course of
                play, but this difference is important during bookkeeping, since it can allow your character to achieve more than they might be able to normally!
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="GeneratingWealth">
        <h2>Wealth</h2>
        <p>
            Coins are the most common form of currency, next to people trading goods for services and vice versa. 
            Coins scale up through 3 levels; Copper, Silver and Gold. Each coin type is worth 10 of the type below it, 
            meaning a single Gold Piece is worth 10 Silver Pieces, and a single Silver Piece is worth 10 Copper Pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
            Coins are valued for their materials and for their volume. This is mentioned because some coins can be more 
            dense, and as a result are worth more than others. Dwarf coins, for example, contain more of each material 
            than others, and are valued accordingly. Because of this, businesses will have scales and weights to determine 
            the weight of each coin before accepting it, which introduces an interesting quark; the mint of a coin doesn’t 
            matter at all, simply the material and the weight, meaning “foreign” currency is accepted all the same as chunks of raw material. 
        </p>

        <h2>Generating Starting Wealth</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Players start with 10 + 1d8 Gold Pieces</strong>. Under normal circumstances, this is used to purchase starting equipment, but ask your 
            gamemaster in case they have other plans. This is also, setting dependant, considered a sizable amount of money, so try not to 
            be too underwhelmed when you’re party’s first treasure haul comes up not too dissimilar from what you started with!
